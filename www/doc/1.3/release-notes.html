    <h1>Herbie 1.3 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
    Herbie 1.3! This release focuses on <em>speed and
    extensibility</em>, including support for posits. Herbie 1.3 is
    also nearly twice as fast as Herbie 1.2, and is more accurate at
    evaluating rounding error.
  </p>

  <p>
    Herbie automatically improves the accuracy of floating point
    expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and surprises that so
    often occur when working with floating point. Since
    our <a href="../../pldi15.html">PLDI'15 paper</a>, we've been hard at
    work making Herbie more versatile and easier to use.

  <h2>Improvement to core algorithm</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Herbie now uses a sound interval-based approach to computing
      the "ground truth" accurate answer for computations. In rare
      cases, this could change Herbie's accuracy estimate for a
      program.</li>
    <li>Simplification can now simplify exact constant expressions
      like <code>(+ 2 2)</code>. This should eliminate some noisy arithmetic
      in Herbie's output.</li>
    <li>Series expansion of <code>pow</code>s with constant exponents
      is now much faster.</li>
    <li>Refactor the implementation of complex numbers so that type checking
      is now done exactly once, significantly speeding up the code.</li>
    <li>Regime inference is now faster and more accurate. Plus, a few
      complex bugs have been eliminated.</li>
    <li>Various fixes to simplification and series expansion to fix
      rare but large slowdowns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Beta-quality features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Herbie now supports John Gustafson's
      <a href="https://posithub.org/">posit</a> format for systems
      supported by
      the <a href="https://gitlab.com/cerlane/SoftPosit">SoftPosit</a>
      library.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usability improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>We have a <a href="../../index.html">new website</a>!
      Hopefully it's a little easier to learn about what Herbie is and
      how to use it.</li>
    <li>Herbie will now prefer simpler to more complex programs in
      several places. This should result in simpler output.</li>
    <li>The Herbie shell now indents and breaks lines when it prints
      FPCores.</li>
    <li>Herbie reports now use <a href="https://katex.org/">KaTeX</a>
      to render math in the browser. KaTeX is significantly faster than
      <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, which we used to use.</li>
    <li>You can now middle-click on the arrows on report pages to open
      in new tab.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Code Cleanup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Reports now display a quality metric for regime inference.
      This should help improve regime inference over time.</li>
    <li>The <kbd>reproduce<kbd> command now allows rerunning a report.</li>
    <li>The timebar in the debug block now separates regime inference
      from binary search.</li>
    <li>Lots of old, unused code has been deleted, including a lot of
      support code for the
      obsolete <a href="https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/herbie-viz.html">Herbie
      Visualizer</a>.</li>
    <li>Move a lot of glue code into a single glue file, clarifying
      responsibilities for a lot of modules.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Try it out!</h2>

  <p>
    We're excited to continue to improve Herbie and make it more
    useful to scientists, engineers, and programmers around the world.
    We've got a lot of features we're excited to work on in the coming
    months. Please
