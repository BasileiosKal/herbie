  <p>
    <a href="../../">Herbie</a> automatically rewrites
      floating point expressions to make them more accurate.
    Floating point arithmetic is inaccurate;
      hence the jokes that 0.1 + 0.2 ≠ 0.3 for a computer.
    But to understand the inaccuracies and reduce them is a much harder task.
    Usually, programs that use floating point arithmetic
      are just written with the hope that these inaccuracies will not cause bugs,
      and when they do, these bugs are mysterious and hard to fix.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get started using Herbie, <a href="installing.html">download and install</a> it.
    Now that Herbie is installed, you're ready to begin using it.
  </p>

  <h2>Giving Herbie expressions</h2>

  <p>Now that Herbie is installed, start it with:</p>

  <pre>herbie web</pre>

  <p>
    After a brief wait, this ought to open a web browser to a page
    with Herbie's results. The most important part of the page is this
    bit:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-prog.png" />
    <figcaption>Input and output program from a Herbie report.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    In the middle of the page is a box where you can input
    mathematical expressions; go ahead and input <kbd>(x + 1) -
    x</kbd> and press enter.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should see the entry box gray out, then some additional text
    appear on the screen describing the various steps Herbie is doing.
    Eventually (after about 20 seconds) you'll be redirected to a page
    with Herbie's results. The most important part of that page is the
    large gray box in the middle:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-prog.png" />
    <figcaption>Input and output program from a Herbie report.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This shows both the input you gave Herbie (<code>(x + 1) -
    x</code>) and what Herbie thinks is a more accurate version of
    that expression (<code>1</code>). Here, Herbie did a good job,
    which you can double check using the statistics above that box:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-large.png" />
    <figcaption>Statistics about the Herbie run.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Here, Herbie reports that the improved the program has 0 bits of
    error, on average, whereas the original program had 29.4. That's
    because, when <code>x</code> is really big, <code>x + 1 = x</code>
    in floating-point arithmetic, so <code>(x + 1) - x = 0</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's <a href="report.html">lots more information</a> on this
    results web page to help explain both what the accuracy is on
    different inputs and to describe how Herbie derived its result.
  </p>

  <h2>Programming with Herbie</h2>

  <p>
    Now that you've run Herbie and know how to read its results,
    let's work through applying Herbie while writing a realistic program.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you're working on a numerical program, it's best to keep
    Herbie open in a browser tab so you can run it easily. That way,
    when you're writing a complex floating-point expression, you can
    run Herbie to make sure you use the most accurate version of that
    expression that you can.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the other hand, if you're tracking down a bug that you think is
    caused by floating-point error, you'll need to identify the
    problematic floating-point expression before you can use Herbie on
    it.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an example, let's use <a href="http://mathjs.org">math.js</a>,
    an extensive math library for JavaScript, and walk
    through <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/pull/208">bug
    208</a>, which found an inaccuracy in the implementation of complex
    square root. (For a full write-up of the bug itself, check out
    a <a href="https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/casio-mathjs.html">blog
    post</a> by one of the Herbie authors).
  </p>

  <h2>Finding the problematic expression</h2>

  <p>
    Before using Herbie you need to know what floating-point
    expressions to feed it. In most programs, there's a small core of
    your application does the mathematical computations, and the rest
    sets up parameters, handles control flow, visualizes or print
    results, and so on. The mathematical core is what Herbie will be
    interested in.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, in the case of math.js, the mathematical core
    is in <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/tree/master/lib/function"><code>lib/function/</code></a>.
    Each file in each subdirectory contains a collection of mathematical functions.
    The bug we're interested in is about complex square root, so let's look at the file
    <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/da306e26ed34272db44e35f07a3b015c0155d99a/lib/function/arithmetic/sqrt.js"><code>arithmetic/sqrt.js</code></a>,
    which contains real and complex square roots.
  </p>

  <p>
    The code handles argument checks, five different number types, and
    error handling. None of that is of interest to Herbie; we want to
    extract just the mathematical computation. So let's look at
    the <code>isComplex(x)</code> case:
  </p>

  <pre>var r = Math.sqrt(x.re * x.re + x.im * x.im);
if (x.im &gt;= 0) {
  return new Complex(
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re)),
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}
else {
  return new Complex(
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re)),
      -0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}</pre>

  <h2>Converting problematic code to Herbie input</h2>

  <p>
    This code contains a branch: one option for non-negative <code>x.im</code>,
    and one for positive <code>x.im</code>.
    While Herbie supports an <code>if</code> construct,
    it's usually better to send each branch to Herbie separately.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, in this code, <code>x</code> is of
    type <code>Complex</code>, a data structure with multiple fields.
    Herbie only deals with floating-point numbers, not data
    structures, so we will treat the input <code>x</code> as two
    separate inputs to Herbie (<code>xre</code> and <code>xim</code>).
    Also, this code produces a data structure as an output;
    we'll pass Herbie each field separately.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, each field of the final output uses the
    variable <code>r</code>, which is defined in the first line of the
    code snippet. When you're using Herbie, you want to expand or
    inline intermediate variables like this, because the definition of
    that variable contains important information that Herbie can use
    to improve accuracy.</p>

  <p>Putting this all together, let's do the first field of the
  non-negative <code>x.im</code> case first. It looks like this:</p>

  <pre>0.5 * sqrt(2.0 * (sqrt(xre * xre + xim * xim) + xre))</pre>

  <h2>Using Herbie's results</h2>

  <p>Before running Herbie on this expression, click the “Additional
  options” link. You should see a box where you can enter a
  precondition; enter <kbd>xim &lt;= 0</kbd>. This makes sure that
  Herbie only considers the points this expression will actually be
  run on when improving the accuracy of this expression.</p>
  
  <p>Herbie will churn for a few seconds and produce an output,
  perhaps something like this:</p>

  <pre>if xre ≤ 0:
    |xim| * sqrt(0.5) / sqrt(sqrt(xre*xre + xim*xim) - xre)
else
    0.5 * sqrt(2.0 * (sqrt(xre*xre + xim*xim) + xre))</pre>

  <p>Herbie's algorithm is randomized, so you might not get exactly
  the same thing. For example, you'll probably won't get <code>xre ≤
  0</code>, but instead <code>xre</code> less than or equal to some
  really small number. But the result should be recognizably similar.</p>

  <p>Now that you have the more accurate version of this expression,
    all you need to do is insert it back into the program:</p>

  <pre>var r = Math.sqrt(x.re * x.re + x.im * x.im);
// Herbie version of 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re))
var re;
if (x.re &lt;= 0) {
    re = Math.abs(x.im) * Math.sqrt(0.5) / Math.sqrt(r - x.re);
} else {
    re = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re));
}
if (x.im &gt;= 0) {
  return new Complex(
      re,
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}
else {
  return new Complex(
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re)),
      -0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}</pre>

  <p>Note that I've left the original code in place in a comment.
  That's because the original code is a bit more readable, and it also
  means that as Herbie gets better, we can re-run it to get future
  improvements in accuracy.</p>

  <h2>Next steps</h2>

  <p>With this change, we've made this part of the complex square root
  function much more accurate, and we could repeat the same steps for
  the other branches and other fields in this program. You now have a
  pretty good understanding of Herbie and how to use it.
