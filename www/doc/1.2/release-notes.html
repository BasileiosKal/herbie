    <h1>Herbie 1.2 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
    Herbie 1.2! This release focuses on <em>accuracy and
    reliability</em>, including better conditionals, more accurate
    defaults, and significant bug fixes to the core algorithms.
  </p>

  <p>
    Herbie automatically improves the accuracy of floating point
    expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and surprises that so
    often occur when working with floating point. Since
    our <a href="../../pldi15.html">PLDI'15 paper</a>, we've been hard at
    work making Herbie more versatile and easier to use.
  </p>

  <h2>Breaking Changes and Deprecations</h2>

  <ul>
    <li> This release fixes a significant and important bug in
      Herbie's measurement of program accuracy. Herbie's prior results
      had a small chance of recommending an inaccurate program as
      accurate. </li>
    <li> In line
      with <a href="http://fpbench.org/spec/fpcore-1.0.html">FPCore
      1.0</a>, we have deprecated the <code>sqr</code>
      and <code>cube</code> functions.</li>
    <li> Herbie no longer
      supports <a href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a> versions
      prior to 6.7. Future Herbie releases may continue to step up
      supported Racket versions to make better use of recent language
      features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Improvement to core algorithm</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Herbie now uses a more rigorous algorithm to evaluate its results,
      both increasing reproducibility of its results and better measuring
      its output.</li>
    <li>Herbie has become much more inventive in what expressions it
      can branch on. This leads to more accurate results in many
      cases. The <kbd>reduce:branch-expressions</kbd>
      <a href="options.html">option</a> controls this feature.</li>
    <li>Herbie now uses a binary search algorithm to choose more
      accurate values for conditionals in <code>if</code> statements.
      This should make different runs of Herbie produce more similar
      results. The <kbd>reduce:binary-search</kbd>
      <a href="options.html">option</a> controls this feature.</li>
    <li>Herbie has a higher default value for
      the <code>--num-iters</code> <a href="options.html">parameter</a>.
      Users should expect Herbie to be slower but to produce more
      accurate results.</li>
    <li>A significant bug in the series expansion algorithm has been
      fixed, improving Herbie's performance in the presence of
      logarithms.</li>
    <li>A small tweak to the simplification algorithm results in
      simpler and more accurate output from Herbie.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Beta-quality features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Herbie now supports basic operations
      on <a href="input.html#complex">complex numbers</a>, using
      the <code>complex</code>, <code>re</code>, and <code>im</code>
      functions. We look forward to releasing high-quality complex
      number support in the future.</li>
    <li>Herbie now supports Windows. Note that the Bessel functions
      are not available in the Windows <code>math.h</code> library and
      use a fallback. The <kbd>precision:fallback</kbd>
      <a href="options.html">option</a> controls this feature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usability improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A new <a href="report.html#try-it">Try It</a> feature in
      reports lets you run the input program and Herbie's suggested
      version on argument values of your choice.</li>
    <li>Herbie can now efficiently sample from preconditions such
      as <code>(or (&lt; 1 x 2) (&lt; 1001 x 1002))</code>. Previously
      such preconditions would produce to the dreaded
      “<a href="faq.html#sample-valid-points">could not sample</a>”
      error message.</li>
    <li>Herbie's web output now includes additional descriptive text,
      such as color keys, and additional intuitive interactions, such
      as clicking on report page arrows.</li>
    <li>Herbie's FPCore output now includes
      its <a href="input.html#properties">error estimates</a>, making
      this information easier for other tools to access.</li>
    <li><code>let</code> statements and variary arithmetic operators
      are now supported in preconditions.</li>
    <li>Herbie will now type-check inputs and report errors for
      mismatches, helping further cut down on confusing error
      messages.</li>
    <li>User errors and Herbie crashes now look different in
      reports.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Code Cleanup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Many bugs fixed, including adding missing rules, infinite
      loops, and a few crashes in exceptional circumstances.</li>
    <li>Herbie’s HTML output now uses the Racket XML library,
      eliminating the possibility of generating invalid HTML.</li>
    <li>Herbie uses a new mechanism for defining supported functions,
      which should adding functions in the future easier.</li>
  </ul>
