    <h1>Installing Herbie</h1>
    <p>See <a href="index.html">the main page</a> for more info on Herbie.</p>
  </header>

  <p>
    <a href="index.html">Herbie</a> depends on <a href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>,
    a dynamic language developed by Northeastern University.
    To install Herbie, one must first install Racket, version 6.1 or later.
    Once Racket is installed, Herbie should run without problems.
  </p>

  <h2>Installing Racket</h2>

  <p>
    Avoid using MacPorts or Brew if you are using OS X;
      we've found that these repositories miscompile the arbitrary-precision libraries
      that Herbie requires.
    Instead, use the <a href="http://download.racket-lang.org/">official installer</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Test that Racket is installed correctly and has a correct version:
  </p>

  <pre><strong>$</strong> racket
Welcome to Racket v6.1.
> (exit)</pre>

  <h2>Installing Herbie</h2>

  <p>
    Once Racket is installed, download the Herbie source
    <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/herbie">from GitHub</a> with:
  </p>

  <pre>git clone https://github.com/uwplse/herbie <var>path/to/herbie/directory</var></pre>

  <p>
    If you go to the directory you downloaded the Herbie source into,
    you should see a <code>README.md</code> file, a directory named <code>herbie</code>,
    a directory named <code>bench/</code>, and a variety of other directories.
    Do a trial run of Herbie to make sure everything is installed and working correctly:
  </p>

  <pre>racket herbie/reports/make-report.rkt bench/hamming/</pre>

  <p>
    This command will take approximately fifteen minutes to run;
      it runs Herbie on problems from Richard Hamming's
      <i>Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers</i>, Chapter 3.
    After the command completes,
      a directory named <code>graphs</code> should have appeared.
    Open up the <code>report.html</code> file inside with your browser;
      you should see a listing of the expressions Herbie was run on,
      most of which should be green.
    A score of 24/28 or greater suggests that everything is working correctly.
  </p>

  <p>Once Herbie is installed and working correctly, you can run it your own inputs by calling</p>
    
  <pre>racket herbie/reports/make-report.rkt <var>file/or/dir</var></pre>
