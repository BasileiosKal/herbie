;;# The mighty enode, one of the main lifeforms of this planet.
;;# Enodes are born solitary creatures, but can be merged to form a pack.
;;# Everytime two groups are merged, a leader is selected for the new pack
;;# from the leaders of the packs that were merged. A solitary
;;# enode is the leader of their own pack.
;;#
;;# The following things are always true of enode packs:
;;# 1. (enode-parent en) always returns either #f, or an enode that is
;;#    part of the same pack as en.
;;# 2. In each pack, there is exactly one enode for which (enode-parent en)
;;#    returns #f, and that enode is the leader of the pack.
;;# 3. The (enode-parent) pointers are non-cyclic, and always eventually
;;#    lead to the leader of the pack.
;;# 4. (enode-children en) is a list of enodes, for which each enode has a parent.
;;# 5. If en2 is the parent of en1, then en1 has the same expression as one of the
;;#    children of en2.
;;# 6. The enode-children links are also non-cyclic.
;;# 7. (enode-depth en) is a positive integer.
;;# 8. Solitary enodes have a depth of 1.
;;# 9. If en2 is the parent of en1, then (enode-depth en2) > (enode-depth en1)
;;# 10. If an enode is the leader of a pack of size n, then the depth of that
;;#     enode is at least log_2(n)
;;#
;;# The following things are true of enodes in general:
;;# 1. (enode-expr en) can take one of three forms:
;;#    a. a symbol
;;#    b. a number
;;#    c. a list starting with a symbol representing an operator,
;;#       and containing one or more enodes.
;;# 2. Each enode within a given context has a unique id-code.
