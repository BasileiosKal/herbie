  From control to forecasting,
    many systems need to model mathematics which uses the real numbers.
  Practical concerns force these applications
    to use hardware-supported floating point.
  The finite precision provided by this approximation
    leads to rounding error.
  Rounding errors in intermediate steps can compound,
    causing programs to produce completely incorrect results.
  While techniques to combat this problem
    are well studied in the numerical methods literature,
    applying these techniques is difficult.
  In practice, developers must move to a larger representation,
    but this is often insufficient and costly.

  We introduce \Casio, a better way
    of reducing floating point rounding error.
  \Casio automatically transforms a floating point computation
    to more accurately represent the underlying real-number computation.
  \Casio performs a heuristic search over program transformations,
    composing local rewrites out of which
    traditional error-reducing transformations emerge.
  This search is directed by techniques from numerical methods
    to estimate rounding error and its causes.
  \Casio automatically detects regimes where error behavior differs,
    and combines multiple programs to reduce error across all regimes.
  We evaluate \Casio on microbenchmarks drawn from
    numerical methods textbooks,
    mathematical libraries,
    and recent scientific articles.
  Our implementation also serves as a foundation
    for others to build upon.

%   Floating point computation is a well known approach to approximating real
% computation in the bounded context of practical hardware.  Recent advances
% provide techniques to trade-off accuracy for improved speed and power usage
% at the cost of precision.  However, this work is often carried out under
% the assumption that the original floating program is the ``ground truth'',
% that is, that it is already an acceptable approximation of the original
% real computation the programmer had in mind.  Unfortunately, approximating
% real computation in floating point presents many subtle challenges which,
% if not accounted for, can yield arbitrarily large errors.  This limits the
% value of recent advances improving the runtime and power efficiency of such
% computations: the wrong answer is simply arrived at more quickly using
% fewer joules (watts? ugh).

% The field of numerical methods provides a rich set of techniques for
% improving the numerical accuracy and precision of real computations
% approximated in floating point.  Unfortunately, applying these techniques
% has traditionally demanded extensive training and expensive manual analysis
% and optimization of numerical programs.  As more and more scientists write
% numerical programs, this lack of accuracy becomes increasingly troubling.
% These non-expert programmers usually lack the training and time necessary
% to employ numerical methods in their code, and often may not even be aware
% of the subtle challenges this domain presents.

% We present a new tool, \casio, which synthesizes floating point programs
% which better approximate the real computations programmers have in mind.
% Casio works by performing a heuristic search over the space of programs
% equivalent to the input program over the reals.  Each step of the search
% attempts to apply identity transformations over the reals that have been
% shown valuable in the numerical methods literature.  Casio also searches
% for alternate representations of programs that may be challenging for even
% for numerical methods experts to develop, for example, special casing
% variants of the program to input domains with better precision for that
% variant.

% We evaluate \casio on a number of examples drawn from numerical methods
% textbooks, scientific journal articles, and math libraries.  We find that
% \casio is often able to improve the precision of these examples
% considerably.
