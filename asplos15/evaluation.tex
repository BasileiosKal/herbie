\section{Evaluation}

\todo{compiler flags order of magnitude speed up !!!}

In addition to the previously discussed examples,
we evaluated \casio on all the examples present
in Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers, chapter 3.
While \casio's behavior is sometimes inconsistent on these examples,
it regularly finds solutions which match or exceed the solutions presented in the book.
