\section{Evaluation}

\todo{compiler flags order of magnitude speed up !!!}

In addition to the previously discussed examples,
we evaluated \casio on benchmarks drawn from
numerical methods textbooks, popular math libraries, 
physics papers from Physical Review A, and standard definitions of mathematical functions.
\todo{reference results}
Beginning from the naive implementation as an AST,
\casio regularly finds vast improvements behavior for those expressions which have high error.
In many cases, the accuracy of the programs outputted by casio 
exceeds that of rewrites provided by numerical methods textbooks.
In many cases, \casio discovers rewrites of a complexity 
such that a human would be unlikely to discover rewrites of equivilent accuracy.
